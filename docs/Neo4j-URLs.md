# have same table that has local installs have rows of community and enterprise at a non local server  and add row(s) to show AuraDB database url and console url.  Mention what Neo4j Desktop supports

Here is the updated table including local installs (Community and Enterprise both on non-local servers) and Neo4j AuraDB cloud URLs. Additionally, I've mentioned what Neo4j Desktop supports.


| Environment | Database Access URL (Bolt) | Browser/Console URL (HTTP) | Notes on Neo4j Desktop Support |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Neo4j Desktop (local) | `bolt://localhost:7687` | `http://localhost:7474/browser` | Supports running both Community \& Enterprise locally, uses Bolt and HTTP URLs as shown |
| Neo4j Community (localhost) | `bolt://localhost:7687` | `http://localhost:7474/browser` | Can be managed via Neo4j Desktop if installed locally or connected externally |
| Neo4j Enterprise (localhost) | `bolt://localhost:7687` | `http://localhost:7474/browser` | Can be managed via Neo4j Desktop if installed locally or connected externally |
| Neo4j Community (non-local server) | `bolt://<server-ip-or-host>:7687` | `http://<server-ip-or-host>:7474/browser` | Neo4j Desktop can connect remotely via bolt and HTTP URLs |
| Neo4j Enterprise (non-local server) | `bolt://<server-ip-or-host>:7687` | `http://<server-ip-or-host>:7474/browser` | Neo4j Desktop can connect remotely via bolt and HTTP URLs |
| Neo4j AuraDB (cloud) | `neo4j+s://<unique-database-id>.databases.neo4j.io` | Aura Console: `https://console.neo4j.io` (web-based console for DB management) <br> AuraDB Browser (sometimes): `https://<dbid>.databases.neo4j.io/browser/` | Neo4j Desktop does **not** support AuraDB directly; use Aura Console and browser tools |

### Key Points:

- Neo4j Desktop primarily supports local and remote connections to Community and Enterprise editions via Bolt and HTTP protocols.
- For Neo4j AuraDB (cloud), use the Aura Console for management and connect using the secure `neo4j+s://` URL for Bolt.
- Neo4j Desktop does not manage AuraDB databases directly but can connect using drivers configured with AuraDB credentials.

This table and explanation cover your requested environments and URL formats comprehensively.
