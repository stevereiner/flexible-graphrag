# Neptune-specific AWS Credentials for Graph Explorer
# Copy this file to docker/neptune.env and modify the values
#
# These credentials are separate from S3 credentials in flexible-graphrag/.env
# because you may use different AWS accounts/regions for Neptune vs S3

# Neptune AWS Credentials (for Graph Explorer)
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_neptune_access_key_here
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_neptune_secret_key_here
AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

# Notes:
# - These credentials are used only by the Graph Explorer container
# - Your main application uses Neptune credentials from flexible-graphrag/.env
# - S3 data source credentials are also in flexible-graphrag/.env
# - This separation allows different AWS accounts/regions for different services
