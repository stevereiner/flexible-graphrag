# Amazon Neptune - Managed Graph Database Service
# 
# Neptune is a fully managed graph database service by AWS.
# It cannot be run locally via Docker as it's a cloud-only service.
# 
# To use Neptune Database with Flexible GraphRAG:
# 
# 1. Create a Neptune cluster in AWS Console:
#    - Go to Amazon Neptune in AWS Console
#    - Create a new database cluster
#    - Note the cluster endpoint and port
# 
# 2. Configure IAM permissions:
#    - Create IAM user with Neptune access
#    - Get Access Key ID and Secret Access Key
# 
# 3. Set environment variables:
#    GRAPH_DB=neptune
#    GRAPH_DB_CONFIG={"host": "your-cluster.cluster-xyz.region.neptune.amazonaws.com", "port": 8182, "region": "us-east-1", "access_key": "your_access_key", "secret_key": "your_secret_key"}
# 
# To use Neptune Analytics with Flexible GraphRAG:
# 
# 1. Create a Neptune Analytics graph in AWS Console:
#    - Go to Amazon Neptune Analytics in AWS Console
#    - Create a new graph
#    - Note the graph identifier
# 
# 2. Set environment variables:
#    GRAPH_DB=neptune_analytics
#    GRAPH_DB_CONFIG={"graph_identifier": "g-1234567890", "region": "us-east-1", "access_key": "your_access_key", "secret_key": "your_secret_key"}
#
# Alternative: Use AWS credentials from environment/profile
#    GRAPH_DB_CONFIG={"graph_identifier": "g-1234567890", "region": "us-east-1"}

# To use the Graph-Explorer with Neptune:
# http://localhost:3007/explorer

# Graph-Explorer: Open-source Neptune dashboard
# Can connect to both Neptune Database and Neptune Analytics from within the UI
# 
# IMPORTANT: Graph Explorer needs Neptune-specific AWS credentials.
# Create docker/neptune.env with Neptune AWS credentials (separate from S3 credentials in main .env):
#   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_neptune_access_key
#   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_neptune_secret_key  
#   AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1

    env_file:
      - ../neptune.env # Loads Neptune-specific AWS credentials from docker/neptune.env
    
  # Note: Within Graph Explorer UI, you can add connections to:
  # 1. Neptune Database: https://your-neptune-instance.region.neptune.amazonaws.com (SERVICE_TYPE=neptune-db)
  # 2. Neptune Analytics: https://your-neptune-analytics-graph.region.neptune-analytics.amazonaws.com (SERVICE_TYPE=neptune-analytics)
  # 
  # Requirements:
  # 1. Network connectivity to your Neptune services
  # 2. Proper AWS credentials in docker/.env file
  # 3. Security group rules allowing connections from this container
    
# Neptune Notebooks  (Jupyter-based, requires AWS setup)
# Neptune Notebooks  cannot be containerized as it's a managed AWS service using SageMaker
# Access via: AWS Console > Neptune > Notebooks > Create notebook instance

# G.V() https://gdotv.com/  commercial tool also supports Neptune
