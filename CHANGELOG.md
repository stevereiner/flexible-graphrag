## [2025-08-09] - MCP Server and Async Processing

### Added
- **MCP Server Implementation**
  - FastMCP-based Model Context Protocol server for Claude Desktop integration
  - HTTP and stdio transport modes (`--transport http`, `--http`, `--serve` flags)
  - Command-line argument parsing for host, port, and transport configuration
  - Multiple installation methods: pipx, uvx, direct Python execution
  - Platform-specific Claude Desktop configurations (Windows/macOS)
  - MCP Inspector debugging support with dedicated configurations
- **MCP Tools**
  - `get_system_status`, `ingest_documents`, `ingest_text`, `search_documents`
  - `query_documents`, `test_with_sample`, `check_processing_status`
  - `get_python_info`, `health_check`
- **Asynchronous Processing Pattern**
  - Background task processing with processing ID system
  - Real-time progress updates with percentage, current file, and phase information
  - Dynamic time estimation based on content size and file count
  - Processing cancellation support with graceful cleanup
  - Server-Sent Events (SSE) endpoints for real-time UI updates
- **UI Enhancements**
  - Progress bars with 0-100% completion tracking across all clients
  - Cancel processing buttons with proper state management
  - Time estimation displays and file-level progress indicators
  - Phase tracking (docling, chunking, indexing, kg_extraction)
  - Auto-clearing status messages and manual dismiss options

### Fixed
- **Asyncio Event Loop Conflicts**
  - Added `nest_asyncio` support to handle nested event loops
  - Wrapped LlamaIndex operations in `loop.run_in_executor()` 
  - Resolved `asyncio.run() cannot be called from a running event loop` errors
- **Neo4j Compatibility Issues**
  - Added `refresh_schema=False` to prevent APOC `apoc.meta.data` calls during initialization
  - Fixed Cypher syntax incompatibility between Neo4j 25.x and LlamaIndex 0.5.0
  - Updated cleanup commands to include `entity` index and LlamaIndex constraints
- **Package Installation Issues**
  - Fixed `pyproject.toml` from `packages = ["."]` to `py-modules = ["main"]` for uvx support
  - Added proper script entry points for system-wide command availability
- **Processing State Management**
  - Implemented intelligent cleanup that preserves functional systems after cancellation
  - Fixed search functionality after completed ingestion followed by cancelled operation
- **UI Client Issues**
  - Fixed Angular compilation errors (MatProgressBarModule, RxJS imports, TypeScript types)
  - Corrected snackbar duration and auto-clearing logic
  - Added proper async status polling in all three UI frameworks

### Changed
- **API Response Format**
  - Ingestion endpoints now return immediate `AsyncProcessingResponse` with `processing_id`
  - Added `/api/processing-status/{id}` and `/api/processing-events/{id}` endpoints
  - Separated `/api/test-sample` (default) and `/api/ingest-text` (custom content) endpoints
  - Enhanced `/api/status` to include `search_db` configuration
- **Configuration Management**
  - Made sample text configurable via `SAMPLE_TEXT` environment variable
  - Organized Claude Desktop configs by platform (windows/, macos/)
  - Separated MCP Inspector configs by transport (stdio/HTTP)
  - Added Unicode environment variables for Windows compatibility

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README.md with multiple installation methods
- QUICK-USAGE-GUIDE.md for streamlined setup
- Platform-specific configuration examples and troubleshooting guides
- Ready-to-use Claude Desktop JSON configurations
- MCP Inspector configs for both stdio and HTTP modes
- Test scripts for installation validation (PowerShell and Bash)

## [2025-08-07] - UI Client Updates and Data Sources

### Added
- React and Vue client modifications to match Angular's data source selection capabilities
- Hybrid search with results list (in addition to Q&A AI query mode)
- CMIS and Alfresco data sources beyond filesystem (Alfresco uses CMIS for getObjectByPath)
- Support for additional document formats that Docling supports

### Changed
- Updated screen images to reflect new hybrid search functionality

## [2025-08-06] - LlamaIndex Integration and Configuration

### Added
- **LlamaIndex Integration**
  - Replaced LangChain with LlamaIndex for document processing
  - VectorStoreIndex and PropertyGraphIndex implementation
  - IngestionPipeline with SentenceSplitter, KeywordExtractor, SummaryExtractor
- **Configurable Architecture**
  - Vector database, graph database, and search database configuration
  - Support for multiple database backends (Neo4j, Qdrant, etc.)
  - Environment-based configuration management
- **Hybrid Search System**
  - Combined vector similarity, BM25 full-text search, and graph traversal
  - AI Q&A mode alongside hybrid search results
  - Configurable retrieval strategies
- **Multi-Source Data Ingestion**
  - Filesystem, CMIS, and Alfresco data source support
  - Docling integration for PDF and Microsoft Office documents
  - Smart table-to-markdown conversion with fallback to text extraction
- **Document Processing**
  - Support for 12+ file formats via Docling
  - Intelligent chunking and metadata extraction
  - Knowledge graph entity and relationship extraction

### Changed
- **Architecture Migration**
  - Migrated from cmis-graphrag/langchain/neo4j-graphrag stack
  - Unified configuration system across all components
  - Angular dialog updates (React and Vue clients pending similar changes)

### Fixed
- Document format support alignment with Docling capabilities
- Filesystem data source integration (CMIS and Alfresco integration planned)

### Technical
- Tested with Neo4j as graph and vector database
- LlamaIndex BM25 as full-text search engine
- Elasticsearch and OpenSearch integration marked for future development

## [2025-08-05] - Initial Project Setup

### Added
