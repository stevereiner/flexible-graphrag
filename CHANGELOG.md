# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.


## [2025-10-16] - Amazon Neptune, Neptune Analytics, Graph Explorer now working, .env + docker.env now no duplication

### Added
- Amazon Neptune and Amazon Neptune Analytics graph databases are now working with flexible graphrag
- A local Graph Explorer https://github.com/aws/graph-explorer in a docker works and can be used to query and visualize with both Amazon Neptune and Amazon Neptune Analytics. This is in neptune.yaml
- added docker-env-sample.txt to copy to docker.env
- added neptune-env-sample.txt top copy to neptune.env to provide keys, region to graph explorer in neptune.yaml docker

### Enhanced
- Previously had to repeat all config in app-stack.yaml flexible-graphrag-backend environment: section, Now use env_file: and include standalone backend flexible-graphrag/.env and override with include of docker.env with just the configs that need urls with host.docker.internal instead of localhost inside docker
- env-sample.txt used as a template for backend .env (and now included in app-stack.yaml for docker) was updated with configs for Amazon Neptune and Amazon Neptune Analytics
- factories.py was updated to get working creation of property graph stores for Neptune and Neptune Analytics
- neptune_analytics_wrapper.py has a wrapper class that works around some vector issues Neptune Analytics Property Graph Store and LlamaIndex have
- hybrid_system disables doing vector embeddings with Neptune Analytics

### Documentation
- In docker dir, new DOCKER-ENV-SETUP.md document way to configure docker with the new flexible-graphrag/.env + docker.env, and neptune.eny
- README.md that covers all dockers for the databases, backend/frontends was update to also have coverage of the new two part env config



## [2025-10-10] - S3 Data Source is now fully working and Docling processing added for S3 files

### Enhanced
- **S3 Data Source Rewrite**

  - Downloads S3 files and gives them to DocumentProcessor (which processes with Docling)
  - Sets up llamaindex documents for llamaindex pipeline integration
  - Progress feedback callbacks are also setup in s3.py
  - Fixed to give feedback in terms of number of documents not count of chunks as doc count

- **Backend S3 Progress Handling**
  - In `backend.py` handling of S3 progressing status was setup
  - Removed 2 un-needed processing status updating in general

- **Progress Feedback Improvements**
  - In `ingest/manager.py` was changed to give better doc count progress feedback
  - In `hybrid_system.py` was changed to give specific feedback for YouTube to be one document not chunk for doc count

- **Frontend S3 Integration**
  - In `ProcessingTab.tsx` for React, `ProcessingTab.vue` for Vue, and `processing-tab.ts` for Angular
  - Code was added to get the progress bar and other feedback to work for S3

### Added
- **S3 Configuration**
  - In `env-sample.txt` configuration for S3 default parameters can be set
  - In `requirements.txt` include boto3 and s3fs for dealing with S3 instead of using llamaindex S3Reader


## [2025-10-08] - Fixed standalone on Linux and Mac, fixed docker with app-stack on Mac

### Fixed

## [2025-10-04] - 3 frontends and backend can now work in docker in addition to in standalone mode

### Added
- **Complete Docker Frontend Support**
  - All three frontends (React, Vue, Angular) now work in Docker with nginx proxy
  - Dual access capability: direct container ports AND nginx proxy routing
  - React: `localhost:3000/ui/react/` and `localhost:8070/ui/react/`
  - Vue: `localhost:5173/ui/vue/` and `localhost:8070/ui/vue/`
  - Angular: `localhost:4200/` and `localhost:8070/ui/angular/`

### Fixed
- **Vue Docker Frontend API Routing**
  - Added proxy configuration to `vite.docker.config.ts` routing `/api` to backend
  - Resolved 404 errors on `/api/upload` endpoint in Docker environment
  - Vue frontend now processes files correctly in Docker deployment

- **Angular Docker Frontend Issues**
  - Fixed blank page issues by switching from static file serving to Angular dev server
  - Added `proxy.docker.conf.json` with backend routing configuration
  - Updated Dockerfile to use `npm run start` instead of static file serving
  - Implemented nginx `sub_filter` to dynamically inject correct base href for dual access

### Enhanced
- **Docker Configuration**
  - Environment variables configured in `app-stack.yaml` instead of `.env` for Docker backend
  - Default Ollama configuration (for OpenAI, update commented/uncommented sections and add API key)
  - Enabled nginx proxy with `proxy.yaml` included in docker-compose configuration

- **Angular Environment Configuration**
  - Added `environment.docker.ts` with Docker-specific settings
  - Updated `api.service.ts` to use `apiUrl = environment.apiUrl` instead of hardcoded `/api`
  - Added Docker build configuration section to `angular.json`

### Maintained
- **Standalone Mode Compatibility**
  - All three frontends continue to work in standalone development mode
  - React: `localhost:3000`, Vue: `localhost:5173`, Angular: `localhost:4200`
  - Separate configuration files ensure no conflicts between Docker and standalone modes

### Technical Implementation
- Vue uses separate `vite.docker.config.ts` with backend proxy configuration
- Angular uses environment-based configuration with Docker-specific proxy setup
- React maintains existing dual access capability (already working)
- nginx `sub_filter` dynamically modifies Angular base href for proxy access compatibility

## [2025-09-28] - Kuzu can now do structured schema if enabled in config, code cleanup

### Enhanced
- env-samples.txt graph_db_config for kuzu now has use_structured_schema and use_vector_index parameters

### Fixed
- Previous code was always setting use_structured_schema to false

### Removed
